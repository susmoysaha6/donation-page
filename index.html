                <p>Around 13 lakh people were affected in Sylhet city, including five Upazilas.
                    Surma and the Kushiyara rivers started flowing above the danger level.
                    The heavy torrential rainfall in the north-eastern region and India's Meghalaya and Assam has left
                    parts of the district paralysed since May 12. The cyclonic storm Asani worsened the situation.</p>
